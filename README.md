Yoast SEO only works in some of my blog posts- shows as not available
The traffic light shows as grey and there's no ability to edit snippet. You can enter a keyword but it doesn't save it or give any feedback/advice. Readability doesn't work either. Basically the whole thing doens't work. However, it works fine in some blog posts. It seems to come and go -only working at times. I've had this problem using my ipad Pro and also from a MacBook. I am working in Wordpress.
